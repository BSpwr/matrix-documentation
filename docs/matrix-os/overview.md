<h2 style="padding-top:0;">MATRIX Open System</h2>

MATRIX Open System (MOS) is open source software for hosting IoT applications. MATRIX Open System runs on node.js, and initially, applications will be written in JavaScript. The current workflow of this platform it to deploy and install apps into your MATRIX device, from a separate computer, anywhere in the world.

## [Getting Started](getting-started)

Learn how to install MOS on your creator and create applications for your MATRIX device.

## [Reference](reference)

Look over the MATRIX Open System SDK to see the current libraries and features we have to offer. This includes CLI tool commands, sensors/component references, dashboard, and many other vital configurations needed to take full advantage of MOS.

## [Examples](examples)

Take a look at examples to show you how you can integrate IFTTT or creating a simple dashboard setup for you MOS application.

## Mobile Applications

<!-- Fundamentally, MATRIX OS applications logically connect hardware with machine learning abstractions. In this way, you can connect the output from a computer vision system to drive real-world behavior in the form of hardware signaling. You can also use third party API's and integrations, such as IFTTT to further customize your application, for yourself, or for end-users.

### Using MATRIX Open System

> MATRIX devices must be linked with your account to use MOS. If your MATRIX device starts with a pulsing blue light, MOS is installed and ready for [Bluetooth Pairing](getting-started/pairing). Otherwise, you can start from scratch with [Manual Installation & Registration](getting-started/installation/). -->

<!-- MOS devices and applications can be managed and observed via the [MATRIX Dashboard](http://dash.matrix.one), or via mobile apps on Android and iOS. 

To learn more about applications, tooling and the dashboard, start at [Overview](overview/index.md)

### Developing MATRIX Applications -->

<!-- > To develop on MOS, you should have some familiarity with JavaScript and how to do command line operations. See [Prerequisites](getting-started/prerequisites.md) for more details. 

First, install the [Command Line Tool](overview/cli.md) and register your device, either via CLI or mobile app. After your device is registered, the best place to start with developing MOS applications is [Hello World](getting-started/hello-world.md). This will get you familiar with the MOS application-device workflow.  -->

<!-- ### Continue
After the CLI is installed, visit [Next Steps](getting-started/next-steps.md) to get started with [examples](examples/index.md), or dive into the [reference](reference/index.md).

When you're done, you can [publish](overview/publishing.md) -->
