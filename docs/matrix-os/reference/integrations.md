## Integrations

External integrations must be enabled via configuration.

### Configuration
```
# in config.yaml
integrations
  - ifttt
```

### IFTTT

[If This Then That](http://ifttt.com) enables a MATRIX device to trigger actions or react to external events. By piggybacking onto the existing [event system](crosstalk.md), MOS can seamlessly integrates with thousands of platforms available on IFTTT.

<!-- ### Zigbee

Zigbee is a popular wireless protocol for smart device control.
