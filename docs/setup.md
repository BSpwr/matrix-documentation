## Power On

Connect at least 2.5A of power to your Raspberry Pi.

A small blue led (not on the ring) flashing once a second indicates that everything is ok on the MATRIX device.

## Next Steps



Where to go next with your MATRIX is entirely dependent on your level of comfort.

- [MATRIX OS](matrix-os/) - A fully managed platform for your devices, data and behaviors, with the primary language being Javascript.
- [MATRIX CORE](matrix-core/) - Centralized software protocol to enable communication with the hardware, with 40+ languages supported.
- [MATRIX HAL](matrix-hal/) - Reprogram your MATRIX device with FPGA and microcontroller tooling. Primarily C++, direct interface into drivers.
