## Overview
MATRIX OS is an open source operating system for hosting IoT applications. MATRIX OS runs on node.js, but applications will be language-agnostic, as we finish writing an API and SDK for different languages. Fundamentally, MATRIX OS applications logically connect hardware and machine learning abstractions. In this way, you can connect the output from a computer vision system to drive real-world behavior in the form of hardware signaling.

## Applications
Applications, on a fundamental level, provides logical connections between physical data producers and consumers.

So it makes sense to think of information as streams and filters instead of objects and trees. JavaScript has an elegant approach to data filtering through callbacks and first-order functions.
